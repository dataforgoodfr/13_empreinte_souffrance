msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<b>Excruciating</b>: Extreme unbearable pain, even briefly. In humans, "
"this would mark the threshold of suffering below which many people choose"
" to end their lives rather than endure it. Triggers involuntary "
"manifestations (screams, tremors, extreme agitation) and cannot be "
"relieved."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<b>Disabling</b>: Constant pain that takes priority over most behaviors. "
"Prevents positive well-being and drastically alters activity level. "
"Requires stronger painkillers and causes inattention to the environment."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<b>Hurtful</b>: Persistent pain with the possibility of brief moments of "
"forgetting during distractions. Reduces the frequency of motivated "
"behaviors and partially alters functional capabilities, while allowing "
"essential activities to be carried out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"<b>Annoying</b>: Noticeable discomfort that can be ignored. Does not "
"interfere with daily activities or motivated behaviors (exploration, "
"comfort, maintenance). No visible expressions of pain or physiological "
"disturbances."
